# Data-driven Inventory Management Modeling using Deep Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is getting increasingly relevant in the field of Business, especially 
with the explosive growth of IoT and autonomous technologies that were promoted by the Fourth
Industrial Revolution. A data-driven Make-to-Stock (MTS) Inventory Management is conducted with
Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents.The agent learns on a sequential decision-making basis to optimize
the production and allocation of apparel products. It learns witht the objective to establish the
right balance between appropriate storage and demand fulfillment. 


In Reinforcement Learning, reward function plays an essential role for the learning process and optimization
of the policy. In this work, a novel reward function named Total Penalty (TP), was proposed and used. 
With the TP reward function, the agent conducted the inventory management with the lowest Total Cost 
and inventory-to-sales ratio. Particularly, Soft Actor Critic (SAC) agent was able to achieve such feats 
by leveraging on its entropy maximization technique and be robust to highly unstable demand.
